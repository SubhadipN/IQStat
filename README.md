# Investigation on Quasi-STAtic Test (IQStaT)

## Description
IQStaT is a class of software developed to investigate the results obtained from the quasi-static (or pseudo-static) test of cantilever columns. The current software (IQStaT1) generates the rectified data and capacity terms (both yield and ultimate) from given experimentally obtained quasi-static data in the case of a cantilever column following the mechanics-based approach proposed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002522">Naskar et al.</a>.

## Instructions to use IQStat1
---
1. Download *IQStaT1.rar* from <a href="https://github.com/SubhadipN/IQStat/blob/main/IQStaT1.rar">here</a>.
2. Unzip *IQStaT1.rar*.
3. Find file 'IQStaT1.input' within the unzipped folder, and enter numerical values (from Line 1 to Line 17) associated with different parameters (for sucessful execution of *IQStat1.exe*) as shown in that file. Representation of various geometrical parameters (from Line 1 to Line 7) for different types of quasi-static experimental arrangements is shown in the figure given below for better clarity.

5. Provide the filename, which includes the experimental data, at the end (i.e., Line 18) of 'IQStaT1.input' file. The filename must not have any blank space.
