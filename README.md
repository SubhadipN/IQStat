# Investigation on Quasi-STAtic Test (IQStaT)

## Description
IQStaT is a class of software developed to investigate the results obtained from the quasi-static (or pseudo-static) test of cantilever columns. The current software (IQStaT1) generates the rectified data and capacity terms (both yield and ultimate) from given experimentally obtained quasi-static data in the case of a cantilever column following the mechanics-based approach proposed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002522">Naskar et al.</a>.

## Instructions to use IQStat1
---
1. Download *IQStaT1.rar* from <a href="https://github.com/SubhadipN/IQStat/blob/main/IQStaT1.rar">here</a>.
2. Unzip *IQStaT1.rar*.
3. Find file 'IQStaT1.input' within the unzipped folder, and enter numerical values (from Line 1 to Line 17) associated with different parameters as shown in that file. Representation of various geometrical parameters (from Line 1 to Line 7) for different types of quasi-static experimental arrangements is shown in image file 'IQStaT1_schematics.png'.

5. Provide the filename, which includes the experimental data, at the end (i.e., Line 18) of 'IQStaT1.input' file. The filename must not have any blank space.
