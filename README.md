# Investigation on Quasi-STAtic Test (IQStaT)

## Description
IQStaT is a class of software developed to investigate the results obtained from the quasi-static (or pseudo-static) test of cantilever columns. The current software (IQStaT1) generates the rectified data and capacity terms (both yield and ultimate) from given experimentally obtained quasi-static data in the case of a cantilever column following the mechanics-based approach proposed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002522">Naskar et al.</a>.

## Instructions to use IQStat1
---

1. Download *IQStaT1.rar* from <a href="https://github.com/SubhadipN/IQStat/blob/main/IQStaT1.rar">here</a>.

2. Unzip *IQStaT1.rar*.

3. Find file *IQStaT1.input* within the unzipped folder, and enter numerical values (from Line 1 to Line 17) associated with different parameters (for sucessful execution of *IQStat1.exe*) as shown in that file. Representation of various geometrical parameters (from Line 1 to Line 7) for different types of quasi-static experimental arrangements is shown in the figure given below for better clarity.

</p>

4. Provide the filename, which includes the experimental data, at the end (i.e., Line 18) of *IQStaT1.input* file. The filename must not have any blank space.

5. Place the file (whose name is provided at the end of *IQStaT1.input* file) in the same folder where *IQStaT1.exe* resides. This file must be in 3-column format with the following values.
	>* 1st column: force readings (in kN) obtained from vertical actuator
	>* 2nd column: displacement readings (in mm) obtained from horizontal actuator
	>* 3rd column: force readings (in kN) obtained from horizontal actuator
Each row of this file corresponds to the increments of the (displacement- or force-controlled) horizontal actuator during the quasi-static experiment.

6. Run *IQStaT1.exe* (note the output filename).

7. The output file will record the rectified data following the same (3-column) format as described in Step 5. The output file will also record the computed yield values at the very end. The output file will be saved at the same folder where *IQStaT1.exe* resides.
