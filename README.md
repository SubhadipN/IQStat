# Investigation on Quasi-STAtic Test (IQStat)

## Description
IQStat is a class of software developed to investigate the results obtained from the quasi-static (or pseudo-static) test of cantilever columns. The current software generates the rectified data and capacity terms (both yield and ultimate) from given experimentally obtained quasi-static data in the case of a cantilever column following the mechanics-based approach proposed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002522">Naskar et al.</a>.
